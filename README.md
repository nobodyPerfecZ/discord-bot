## Run the Bot on a Linux Server with ``screen`` ðŸ’»
This guide explains how to run the discord bot even after closing your SSH connection using the ``screen`` package from Linux.
1. Ensure ``screen`` is installed on your server:
```bash
sudo apt install screen
```
2. Launch a ``screen`` session: 
```bash
screen
```
3. Within the screen session, run the Python script to start the bot:
```bash
python main.py
```
4. You can now safely close your SSH connection.
The bot will continue running in the background within the screen session.
To reconnect later use `screen -ls` to see a list of active ``screen`` sessions.
Identify the session ID (e.g. ``14760.pts-2.raspberrypi``) and reattach using:
```bash
screen -r <session_id>
```
5. To stop the bot, use the following command to quit the session entirely:
```bash
screen -XS <session-id> quit
```
