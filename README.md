### Build the Discord Bot via Docker üê≥

1. **Clone the Repository**

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nobodyPerfecZ/discord-bot.git
```

2. **Adjust the config.yaml file**

The `config.yaml` file defines the bot's default settings, including which roles are allowed to use specific commands and in which text channels commands can be executed.

Since each role and text channel in Discord has a unique ID, you need to customize the `config.yaml` file to match your server's configuration. This ensures the bot operates correctly within your Discord server.

3. **Add your Discord Token to compose.yaml file**

In the `compose.yaml` file, locate the `TOKEN` key and add your Discord API token there. This token is required for the bot to connect to your Discord server.

4. **Build application with Docker**

Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system. If not, refer to the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Once installed, you can build and run the Discord bot using Docker Compose with the following command:

```bash
sudo docker compose up -d --build
```

After running this command, the Discord bot should start and appear online in your Discord server.
