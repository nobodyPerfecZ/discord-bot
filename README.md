### Build the Discord Bot via Docker üê≥

1. **Clone the Repository**

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nobodyPerfecZ/discord-bot.git
```

2. **Adjust the config.yaml file**

The `config.yaml` file defines the bot's default settings, including which roles are allowed to use specific commands and in which text channels commands can be executed.

3. **Add your Discord Token to compose.yaml file**

In the `compose.yaml` file, locate the `TOKEN` key and add your Discord API token there. This token is required for the bot to connect to your Discord server.

4. **Build application with Docker**

Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your system. If not, refer to the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/). Once installed, you can build and run the Discord bot using Docker Compose with the following command:

```bash
sudo docker compose up -d --build
```

After running this command, the Discord bot should start and appear online in your Discord server.
