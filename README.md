## Run the Bot on a Linux Server with `screen` ðŸ’»

This guide explains how to run the discord bot even after closing your SSH connection using the `screen` package from Linux.

1. Ensure `screen` is installed on your server:

```bash
sudo apt install screen
```

2. Launch a `screen` session:

```bash
screen
```

3. Within the screen session, run the Python script to start the bot:

```bash
python main.py
```

4. You can now safely close your SSH connection.
   The bot will continue running in the background within the screen session.
   To reconnect later use `screen -ls` to see a list of active `screen` sessions.
   Identify the session ID (e.g. `14760.pts-2.raspberrypi`) and reattach using:

```bash
screen -r <session_id>
```

5. To stop the bot, use the following command to quit the session entirely:

```bash
screen -XS <session-id> quit
```
